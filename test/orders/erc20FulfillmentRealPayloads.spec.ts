/**
 * The ERC20 preflight against captured `POST /api/v2/listings/fulfillment_data`
 * responses.
 *
 * opensea-sdk#1997 and monorepo #638 were both reported by a member of the
 * public: the preflight looked for `basicOrderParameters` while the API sends
 * `inputData.parameters`, and the hand-written unit fixture used the same wrong
 * name. Code and tests agreed with each other and disagreed with the wire, so
 * the guard was inert in production for months while its suite stayed green.
 *
 * These four fixtures are response bodies verbatim, covering both call shapes
 * the endpoint returns for a single listing (`fulfillBasicOrder_efficient_6GL6yc`
 * and `fulfillAdvancedOrder`) in both an ERC20-priced and a native-priced form.
 * Each one is run through `camelizeKeysDeep` first, which is the transform the
 * fetcher applies before the SDK touches the response, so the path under test
 * starts at the bytes the API sent.
 *
 * The expected total comes from the listing price reported by a different
 * endpoint, `GET /api/v2/orders/chain/{chain}/protocol/{addr}/{hash}`, recorded
 * in each fixture's `_capture.listing_price`. Asserting against a number
 * re-derived from the same struct the preflight parses would prove nothing.
